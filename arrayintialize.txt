Bro you have not initialised you dp[] array because of which, maybe it is taking garbage value / no value at all (I haven’t debugged it cause it seemed to be an obvious error)at some point of time.

Just add this line after you declaration of ll dp[n+1]:

-> memset(dp,0,sizeof(dp));

it’ll work fine then! :+1:
