bubble and insertion
1)both adaptive(means it does not swap if its already swapped) and stable(duplicate elements remain in their original position).

2)bubble sort can be used to find the kth largest elements while selection sort can be used to find kth smallest elements.

3)selection sort has only O(n) swaps while bubble and insertion sorts have O(n^2)swaps.

4)selection sort is neither adapative nor  stable .

5)merge sort is stable.
